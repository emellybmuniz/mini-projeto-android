## 🚀 Project Overview

![Project Demonstration](./imagens/interface.png)

This project is a single-page website created to present the history of the Android mascot. It covers the origin of the first mascot concepts, the creation of the famous Bugdroid by Irina Blok, and curiosities about the Android version names. The layout is designed to be pleasant and readable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## ✨ Highlights & Features

- **Semantic HTML:** The code is structured with semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Custom Fonts:** Uses `@font-face` to load a custom font for titles.
- **Embedded Media:** Includes a responsive, embedded YouTube video.
- **Advanced CSS:** Features gradients, box-shadows, pseudo-elements, and transitions for a better user experience.
